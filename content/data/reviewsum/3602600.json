The core mechanics are incredibly straightforward because your only responsibility is to sail a boat and gather fish from randomly spawning fishing spots within a limited ocean area.\n\nFishing itself doesn’t involve any complex mini-games or mechanics. You simply press a button, wait a second or two for a progress bar to fill, and the catch is yours. While it is possible to break through the invisible barrier surrounding the play area, there's nothing out there but a never-ending ocean.\n\nThere’s no cap on how many fish you can carry, so you're free to fish as much as you like. However, once your health begins to drop or you feel you've collected enough, it’s time to return to port. At the port, fish serve as your currency to either repair your vessel or purchase upgrades. There are five main upgrades available: increased boat speed, improved gunfire rate, enhanced firepower, a better boost, and more fish from fishing spot. Each upgrade can be bought up to three times. Fully upgrading all systems takes roughly ten minutes, so progression almost feels a bit too fast.\n\nThe game does include threats to keep things a bit more dynamic. You'll encounter whirlpools, enemy fishing boats, and more. You can either evade these dangers using a boost, which recharges after a short cooldown, or eliminate the enemy boats with your onboard fish gun. The gun fires from the front of your ship, using fish as ammo. While your aim is limited to a forward-facing arc, it’s wide enough to hit most threats ahead. After taking several hits, enemy boats sink, often leaving behind a stash of fish or explosive barrels.\n\nTo maintain engagement, the game adds more challenges as time goes on. A timer runs in the background, and as you survive longer, the sea becomes increasingly hostile. New threats appear, such as sharks, giant tentacles, and even artillery fire from coastal defenses and a patrolling battleship. Eventually, the number of dangers in the water outweighs the available fishing spots. On the upside, enemy ships are affected by these same threats and will even engage each other in combat.\n\nOccasionally, enemy ships drop power-ups when destroyed. These include temporary invincibility, rapid-fire mode, instant repairs via first aid kits, and long-range artillery, which allows you to take out distant targets like enemy gun placements.\n\nThe downside is that the game reveals all of its content within the first 15 minutes. Even the battleship, while intimidating, poses little real danger and offers no rewards upon defeat. With careful play, it’s easy to survive indefinitely by collecting first aid and letting the battleship eliminate rival boats. \n\nIn the end, how long you spend with the game depends on your desire to unlock every achievement. However, even grinding for distance and fish-related milestones doesn’t take very long. Unfortunately, some of these achievements unlock the moment you launch the game. This is due to your in-game profile already showing a substantial amount of distance traveled, despite it being your first time playing.","timestamp_created":1751377907,"timestamp_updated":1751377907,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.556797027587890625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":false,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false,"primarily_steam_deck":false}],"cursor":"*"}
