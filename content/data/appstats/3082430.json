He orders the twins to be executed because they are growing too powerful. The twins escape the assassination attempt and swear to kill Tyrek for betraying them. In the twins’ attempt at revenge, Tyrek nearly kills them by stabbing them and throwing them off a cliff.<br><br>The twins wake up battered and bruised across the world without their magic. They vow to enact revenge on Tyrek Tefari, no matter what army stands in their way. Enya and Kyra will discover what it means to be leaders, what it means to do good for others and what morality means in this epic tale to be experienced. The twins will meet barons and kings of different leadership qualities and learn from them all to become queens themselves. Initially their goals are all about revenge and whatever it takes, but eventually they see the effect they have on the people they help.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Unique Sword-Throwing Combat</h2>It’s not every day you see a player juggle swords and throw them around. The player has 4 weapon slots where they can throw them and leave them on the ground. Magical weapons will have certain effects when they are stuck on the ground.
