"detailed_description": "​A festive hangman type word game which is fun to play.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDon't Melt the Snowman is a word game that is often played by one or more people. The game is a simple yet engaging way to test one's vocabulary and guessing skills. Here's how the game typically works:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSetup: Don't Melt the Snowman will generate a word, based on a festive time of year, and keeps it a secret in its memory bank. The chosen word is usually related to a specific category, such as Christmas or other celebration.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMelting the snowman: The original game traditionally involves drawing a gallows (a structure used for hangings) and an empty space for each letter of the chosen word. The number of spaces represents the number of letters in the word.  In Don't Melt the Snowman, the gallows are replaced by a Snowman figure that will slowly melt if your guess at a letter in the word is not successful.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGuessing Letters: For each correct guess, the letter is revealed in its correct position(s) in the word, and the Snowman figure remains unchanged. For incorrect guesses, a different image of the Snowman is presented signifying a melting Snowman character.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLimited Incorrect Guesses: As a player you will only have a limited number of incorrect guesses. If you exceed this limit before guessing the word correctly, you will lose the game and the Snowman will be completely melted - poor Snowman!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWinning or Losing: The game continues until the word is guessed correctly, or the Snowman has melted. If the word is guessed successfully, you win that round and the choice to play again will be displayed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe original Hangman game, from which Don't Melt the Snowman is based upon, is a popular game for its simplicity and adaptability. It can be played with pen and paper, on a whiteboard, or through various online platforms. Additionally, it is often used as an educational tool to reinforce vocabulary and spelling skills.  Don't Melt the Snowman is an online platform with very much of a fun way of using word play!",
