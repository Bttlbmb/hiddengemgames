### What players like

Players like SpritePile for its unique concept of creating 3D-like sprites using layered 2D pixel art. They appreciate its simplicity and ease of use, making it accessible to those without extensive art experience. Additionally, the ability to create low-poly models and export them to other software is a major plus for many users.

### What players donâ€™t like

Players often complain about the lack of features, such as an eraser tool, duplicate function, and selection tool that is not a rectangle. They also find it difficult to add different colors, especially using hex codes. Some users also mention that the program is not well-suited for larger projects due to the limitations of zooming in and out.
