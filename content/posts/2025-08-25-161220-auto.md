### Overview

WREST is a sci-fi horror VR game about delving into nightmares to save an out-of-control spaceship from disaster. Solve a dark, twisted story and master edge-of-your-seat combat — but whatever you do, don’t close your eyes. I didn't feel like I was in some weird indie horror game where they had their friends and family do the voice acting because it was cheap... I get that the situation has almost no hope to it, but that was genuinely a great opportunity to then have to sneak around the ship to avoid all the other crew members that started breaking out of the pods....

### What players like

To be honest, it's only the 2nd VR game that I've played thru (The Room VR being the first.) There were several "Jump Scares." It was definitely fun to let the story unfold.
